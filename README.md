# DeepLearningMK3
 So hey this is my neural networks working area. Until now i was creating a new repo
for every try. But i m just tired of it :D . If you want to inspect something from 
these code lines all you have to do is clone it and then decomment it and it will work just fine 




 h1 is for mnist datas. This code is very basic Hello World! of the neural networks.

h2 is for imdb data set. These datas contain positive or negative comments and with 
this network i m processing which ones are positive or negative.

h3 is for retures data set.

h4 is for boston housing dataset. K fold method introduced in this section
